# ED8-ASL
A Livesplit ASL script for autosplitting and removing load times from Trails of Cold Steel.

To install:
-Open Livesplit and set current comparison method to Game Time.
-Select Edit Layout, and add a Control > Scriptable Auto Splitter.
-Double click the Scriptable Auto Splitter and navigate to the .asl file.

This script will remove load times from screen transitions and skipped battle animations. I'm currently working on cutscene
transitions; ETA unknown.
